# Map Icons for OramaChain

This folder contains the map marker icons used by the Leaflet maps in the OramaChain application.

## Required Files

The following files need to be downloaded from the Leaflet distribution:

- `marker-icon.png` - Default blue marker
- `marker-icon-2x.png` - Retina version of the default marker
- `marker-shadow.png` - Shadow for the markers

Additionally, we need custom icons for different facility types:

- `warehouse-icon.png` - Custom icon for warehouses
- `factory-icon.png` - Custom icon for factories 
- `port-icon.png` - Custom icon for ports
- `store-icon.png` - Custom icon for retail stores

## How to Download

You can download the default Leaflet marker icons from:

```
https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/images/marker-icon.png
https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/images/marker-icon-2x.png
https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/images/marker-shadow.png
```

For the custom icons, you can use icons from icon packs like Font Awesome or Material Design Icons, and save them as PNG files with a transparent background.
